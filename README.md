# Movies and Weather Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It is recommended to use **Node.js 20** to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js version 20 installed.

### Installation

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app running.

### note to the evaluator / reader


This project integrates information from a movies API and a weather API to subsequently send it to a webhook.

There are many areas for improvement, including adding unit tests, better error handling, and consuming another API to increase the available cities. However, the project meets its main objective, which is to integrate multiple APIs.

Additionally, since the role is for an AWS Developer, I chose to deploy the project using AWS Amplify to demonstrate my skills on the platform. You can view the deployed project at the following link: [https://main.d1ymkk3ok0gb8b.amplifyapp.com/](https://main.d1ymkk3ok0gb8b.amplifyapp.com/).
